Gaming Club App
Abstract
This project develops a Membership and Game Management System using Spring Boot and MongoDB for managing the operations of a gaming center. The system enables administrators to manage memberships, games, recharges, transactions, and daily collections via secure REST APIs. Members are registered with an initial joining fee that updates their balance. Recharges and game plays are recorded as separate documents, and balances are automatically adjusted. The system maintains daily collections and provides detailed member histories. Authentication ensures only authorized administrators can access the system. With MongoDB’s flexible schema and scalability, the solution eliminates manual tracking, improves accuracy, and offers a reliable digital platform for efficient gaming center management.
